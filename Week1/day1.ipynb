       "'Here’s a clear, simple explanation of what a Schengen visa is and how it works.\\n\\nWhat is a Schengen visa?\\n- It’s a short-stay visa (usually called a Type C visa) that lets you travel to most of Europe for tourism, business, or visiting family/friends.\\n- With a Schengen visa, you can move between most of the Schengen Area countries without going through border checks at internal borders.\\n- It does not cover long stays (work, study, or residency) in any one country; those require national (long-stay) visas.\\n\\nWhat is the Schengen Area?\\n- The area includes 26 countries: Austria, Belgium, Czechia, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland.\\n- Some are EU members (most), some are non-EU but part of Schengen (Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, Switzerland).\\n- Note: Ireland is not in Schengen, and some EU states (like Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus, Romania) have not always been in Schengen (check current status if you plan those countries).\\n\\nKey facts about the short-stay visa (Type C):\\n- Maximum stay: 90 days in any 180-day period (the 90/180 rule).\\n- Entry options: single-entry, double-entry, or multiple-entry visas (most are now multi-entry for frequent travelers).\\n- Validity vs. length of stay: The visa can be valid for months or years for multiple-entry travel, but you may only stay a total of 90 days within any 180-day window.\\n- It is typically issued by the consulate of the country where you will spend the most time or your first entry into Schengen.\\n\\nWhat you can use it for:\\n- Tourism, business meetings, visiting family/friends, short courses, or transit through Schengen airports (A-type transit visas exist in limited cases, but most travelers need C-type for stays).\\n\\nWhat you usually need to apply (common requirements):\\n- Passport valid for at least 3 months after your planned departure from the Schengen Area, issued within the last 10 years.\\n- A completed visa application form and passport-sized photos.\\n- Travel itinerary: proof of planned travel, dates, and accommodation (hotel bookings or a letter of invitation).\\n- Travel medical insurance covering at least 30,000 euros for medical emergencies in the Schengen Area.\\n- Proof of sufficient funds to cover your stay (bank statements, sponsorship letter, etc.).\\n- Sometimes additional documents: invitation letter, proof of employment or student status, and purpose of travel documents.\\n\\nHow to apply (typical steps):\\n1) Determine which country’s consulate you should apply to (usually the country of your main stay or your first entry).\\n2) Check the official consulate or visa center website for the exact list of documents and any country-specific forms.\\n3) Book an appointment for biometrics (photo and fingerprints) and submit your documents.\\n4) Pay the visa fee (adults often around 80 euros; reductions may apply for children or certain categories).\\n5) Wait for processing (times vary; commonly 15 days, but can take longer in some cases).\\n6) If approved, collect your visa and travel with it and the supporting documents.\\n\\nTips and common pitfalls:\\n- Start the process well in advance (at least 15 days before travel; some cases require more time).\\n- Make sure your travel plans are plausible and well-documented (in particular, your accommodation and flight bookings).\\n- Don’t book non-changeable tickets before you have the visa, unless your airline allows you to change dates easily.\\n- Be honest about your plans; inconsistent information can cause a denial.\\n- If your visa is denied, you may have the option to appeal or reapply with additional documents (check the specific country’s rules).\\n\\nWould you like me to tailor this to your situation? If you share:\\n- Your country of citizenship,\\n- Your destination (which Schengen country or countries),\\n- How long you plan to stay and when,\\n- Whether you’ll spend more time in one country or several,\\nI can outline the exact steps, required documents, and which consulate to apply to.'"

      "What is the OpenAI API? | OpenAI Get started Get started for free Home Courses Working with the OpenAI API What is the OpenAI API? 1 . What is the OpenAI API? Welcome to the course! I'm James, and I'll be your host as we explore the artificial intelligence functionality available via the OpenAI API! 2 . Coming up... In this course, you'll learn how to use the AI models available through the OpenAI API to solve a wide range of real-world tasks. To do this, we'll be using Python code throughout the course, and expect familiarity with a few Python programming topics like subsetting lists and dictionaries, control flow, and looping. However, no experience with AI or machine learning is required. With that, let's dive in! 3 . OpenAI, ChatGPT, and the OpenAI API OpenAI is a company that researches and develops artificial intelligence systems. One of their most famous developments is ChatGPT, which is an application that allows users to communicate with an AI-powered chatbot to ask questions, perform tasks, or generate content. The OpenAI API allows individuals or organizations to access and customize any of the models developed and released by OpenAI. 4 . OpenAI, ChatGPT, and the OpenAI API If OpenAI was a car manufacturer, ChatGPT would be their shiny new sports car that people can walk into a dealership and test drive. 5 . OpenAI, ChatGPT, and the OpenAI API The OpenAI API would be like the system customers could use to customize and order cars from the manufacturer's catalog. 6 . What is an API? So what actually is an API? API stands for Application Programming Interface, and they act as messengers between software applications, taking a request to a system and receiving a response containing data or services. 7 . What is an API? APIs are like waiters in a restaurant; they take our order, or request, communicate it to the kitchen - the system providing the service - and finally, deliver the food, or response from the system, back to our table. 8 . What is an API? Many applications interact using APIs; for example, a mobile weather app may send our location to an API and request the local weather forecast, which is returned back to our phones. 9 . The OpenAI API Similarly, we can write code to interact with the OpenAI API and request the use of one of their models. 10 . The OpenAI API Our request, in this case, will specify which model we want, the data for the model to use, and any other parameters to customize the model's behavior. The response, containing the model result, is then returned. 11 . API vs. web interface Some of OpenAI's models can be used from the web browser, such as via ChatGPT. This low-setup browser experience is often sufficient for streamlining our workflows using AI. However, if we're looking to begin integrating AI into our products, customer experiences, and business processes, we'll need the flexibility of working with the models programmatically using an API. 12 . Building AI applications The OpenAI API has enabled the development of powerful new features, that before, would have required enormous computational resources and data. In this example, from DataLab-DataCamp's own AI-powered IDE-we developed a feature where you can use natural language to extract insights from data - all built on the OpenAI API! I highly recommend giving it a try! 13 . Let's practice! Time to test your understanding!

    "text = \"Sure—here’s a simple, plain-language overview of what a Schengen visa is and how it works.\\n\\nWhat is a Schengen visa?\\n- It’s a single visa (usually called a Schengen short-stay visa) that lets you travel to most of the countries in the Schengen Area with one visa.\\n- It is intended for short trips like tourism, business meetings, or family visits.\\n\\nWhat is the Schengen Area?\\n- A group of European countries that have removed internal border controls, so you can move from one member country to another without a passport check at internal borders.\\n- A Schengen visa allows travel to (most of) these countries with one document. Some countries in Europe are not in Schengen (for example, Ireland and some others; some EU members are not in Schengen yet). Always check the official embassy site for the latest list.\\n\\nKey rules to know\\n- Maximum stay: 90 days in any 180-day period (this is a rolling rule, not a fixed block). So you can stay 60 days now and then you’d have to wait longer before re-entering, depending on your days in the last 180 days.\\n- It is for short stays only. It does not grant the right to work or live there long-term.\\n- It is not a guarantee of entry. Border guards can still refuse entry at the point of entry.\\n\\nWho needs a Schengen visa?\\n- Nationalities that are not visa-exempt for short stays typically need to apply before travel.\\n- Some people from visa-exempt countries can travel to Schengen countries for up to 90 days in 180 days without a visa, but they must have a valid passport and may still be asked to show funds, return tickets, and travel purpose at the border.\\n\\nTypes and scope\\n- Type C (short-stay Schengen visa): for tourism, business, family visits, etc., valid for up to 90 days in 180 days.\\n- Not for long stays, work, or study (those usually require a national long-stay visa or residence permit of a specific country).\\n\\nHow to apply (general steps)\\n1) Check if you need a visa: which country you’ll spend the most time in, or the country you’ll enter first.\\n2) Gather documents (varies by country, but common items include):\\n   - Valid passport (often must be valid for 3–6 months after your planned trip)\\n   - Passport photos\\n   - Travel itinerary (dates, flights, hotels)\\n   - Travel insurance covering medical emergencies with a minimum amount (often around 30,000 euros)\\n   - Proof of funds (bank statements)\\n   - Proof of accommodation\\n   - Letter of invitation or purpose of travel (if applicable)\\n3) Fill out the application form and book an appointment at the consulate or visa application center for the country you’re applying to.\\n4) Attend the appointment with your documents and pay the fee.\\n5) Wait for processing. Typical processing times are around 15 days, but can be longer in some cases.\\n\\nWhere to apply\\n- Apply through the embassy/consulate or official visa center of the country you plan to visit (or where you’ll spend the most time). If you have multiple countries, you generally apply to the one that is your main destination or your first entry point.\\n\\nTips and common pitfalls\\n- Use official sources: the embassy or consulate website for your country of nationality or the country you’ll visit. Be wary of third-party sites charging extra.\\n- Ensure all documents are complete and accurate; inconsistent information is a common cause for delays or denial.\\n- Apply well in advance but not too early (usually a few months ahead is typical; check the specific country’s guidance).\\n- Make sure your travel insurance meets the required coverage limits and duration.\\n- Remember: a visa does not guarantee entry; you must also satisfy border-control criteria when you travel.\\n\\nIf you tell me your nationality, which Schengen country you’ll visit, and your travel dates, I can give you a more tailored overview of whether you likely need a visa and what documents you’d typically need.'\""
